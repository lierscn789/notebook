    "This is my first stab at a Kaggle script. I have chosen to work with the Titanic dataset after spending some time poking around on the site and looking at other scripts made by other Kagglers for inspiration. I will also focus on doing some illustrative data visualizations along the way. I'll then use `randomForest` to create a model predicting survival on the Titanic. I am new to machine learning and hoping to learn a lot, so feedback is very welcome! \n",
